Create and Manage Notification Channels
Starting in Android 8.0 (API level 26), all notifications must be assigned to a channel. 
For each channel, you can set the visual and auditory behavior that is applied to all notifications in that channel.
Then, users can change these settings and decide which notification 
channels from your app should be intrusive or visible at all.


Caution: If you target Android 8.0 (API level 26) and post a notification without specifying a notification channel, 
the notification does not appear and the system logs an error.
